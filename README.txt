The folder /TopologyOptimizatoinToolbox contains all the Matlab functions
The folder /Examples contains files required for some of the examples

The matlab files strarting with MI are examples in which the mesh files 
are imported from the /Examples folder. 

The matlab files starting with MG are examples in which the mesh is 
generated by the topology optimization toolbox. These take longer to run 
as the mesh has to be generated. It is not recomended to generate meshes
with more that 200 000 nodes as the optimization might take too long. 

The most complete example is MG_simpleHinge. 

The fastest example(with a reasonable number of elments) is MI_thinBeam. 

Each time the optimization is run, two folders will be created under 
/RESULTS/<folderName> and /ITERATIONS/<folderName> with the optimization 
results and with figures of each iteration.



Some more information and sources :
 
1.1 Importing the Mesh
	The mesh is imported through a python script(transformData.py) 
	which generates two text files: connectivity.txt and 
	coordinates.txt these are then imported into matlab. Takes in 
	Optistruct .fem files. When exporting, do not remove E real
	values. 

1.2 Generating the Mesh 
	The mesh generation algorithm is based on the general idea from 
	Per. Olof. Persson and Gilbert Strang. “A simple Mesh Generator in
	Matlab”. In: SIAM Review 46 (2 2006), pp. 329–345. doi: 10.1137/
	S0036144503429121

2.0 Finite Element Analysis
	Much of the information for the development of the finite element
	analysis functions was obtained from three sources: 
	- Richard  H.  Galagher.Finite  Element  Analysis:  Fundamentals. 
	  Prentice-Hall, 1975.isbn: 978-0133172485
	- K. J. Bathe.Finite  Element  Procedures  for  Solids  and  
	  Structures-LinearAnalysis. Online Lecures. https://ocw.mit.edu/
	  resources/res-2-002-finite-element-procedures-for-solids-and-
	  structures-spring-2010/linear/: MIT-OCW,1982.
	- Young W. Kwon and Hyochoong Bang.The Finite Element Method using
  	  MATLAB. CRC Press, 1997.isbn: 0-8493-9653-0.

3.1 BESO Optimization
	The main source on information on this topic was: 
	- X. Huang and Y.M. Xie.Evolutionary  Topology  Optimization  of  
	  Contin-uum  Structures,  Methods  and  Applications.  John  Wiley  
	  and  Sons,  2010.isbn: 978-0-470-74653-0.

3.2 SIMP Optimization
	Other than Huang et Xie 20120, the following was very useful: 
	- Wenjie Zuo and Kazuhiro Saitou. “Multi-Material Topology 
	Optimization using Ordered SIMP Interpolation”. In:Structural  
	and  MultidisciplinaryOptimization 55 (2016),  pp.  477–491.
	doi:10.1007/s00158-016-1513-3.


0.0 "Not quite 99 lines though"
	This was all inspired by: 
	- O. Sigmund. “A 99 Line Topology Optimization Code written in 
	  Matlab”.In:Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization(2001).
	  doi:10.1007/s001580050176.
